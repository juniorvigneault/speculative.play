##### Brainstorming Ideas :
1. People don't have to remember anything because there is a tool that helps them remember things, even the most important stuff. For example the birthday of their children, prewritten messages... When I had Facebook and my birthday was reminded to so many people (some I cared about but other no) I got so many birthday messages, but now that I'm not there anymore I literally have like 2-3 people tell me Happy Birthday by text messages and 1 person calls me. I feel like before FB people felt the responsibility to call me for my birthday, but when I was on FB people started relying on that system to remind them it was my BD. Now that I'm gone it's like they don't do the effort of contacting me somewhere else. Which makes it seem like they didn't care in the first place... Or maybe they got super reliant on the remember thingy of FB. ANYWAYS, I literally don't care so much about that but I still think it's interesting that technology can take the burden of calling our loved ones off our shoulders.  Also when you can write happy birthday to someone on Messenger for example, you don't have to call the person anymore. Calling felt more genuine and real for me. Why would you wish me happy birthday on Facebook if you don't really care. It doesn't mean anything I find. For example my Dad used to call me but now he only wishes by Messenger (days later might I add). But maybe I just have a shitty dad.
2. A tool for parenting at distance. With the pandemic we realized that we could do a lot of stuff at distance, while being able to do other stuff at the same time or being comfortable in our home. This tool is made for parents that want to educate their child at distance. Or maybe it could be a tool to take care of stuff at distance and show how ridiculous this could be. Kind of my way of saying we can't do EVERYTHING from distance.
3. Really struggling to be excited about anything today.

##### Brainstorming Ideas :
1. A game that is not really a game at first, but slowly becomes a game. Like a spreadsheet that becomes a game. This has been an idea I had for a while but don't know if it makes sense in terms of Speculative Play. A game with only serious things from the internet like Jquery elements, or basic html stuff. The music and sounds make the game super epic and detailed. Could be about someone working at an office but finds a sort of breach in the system where all his work stuff (folders, numbers, documents, spreadsheets) become a world in which the player has to solve puzzles and fight against the corporate world to escape. Kiiiiinda starting off like It's as if your are doing work in a sense where you are a working employee with a desktop and emails and stuff, but then switches to this weird minimalist adventure world. I just have this weird image of a big castle on a white background made of html tags or something, with epic music. Creatures to fight would be Jquery UI stuff like datepickers or Dialog boxes... I think it would be a good setting to unleash creativity but still inside a limited frame. It's a huge idea though, and I don't know how I would do that, because I wouldn't want it to be tooooo linear. Like side-quests and semi/open world haha. It's not really speculative though.
2. OK I HAD A SPECULATIVE IDEA: Clubbing in the future? I was looking for a way to be able to implement some short loops of house and dance music I produced in my games and this could be a potential idea? I have a friend who ''chills'' on the internet with his friends, drinking and partying I guess but sitting on his chair talking to his friends. So I could make a game about representing clubbing in the future online in a sort of realistic way... There could be a murder in the club while you are there online and you have to help solve it. OH! I just had an idea: someone was talking I can't remember who about getting hit by someone online or like someone entering your bubble, like that's weird, it's like online assault, I could talk about that, and about how to deal with those things too in a way. But like in an absurd way like death, I don't want it to be too not funny and serious. OMG it could be called Blood in the Club. I always wanted to name something Blood in the Club. This title has been on my cool title lists for AGES. I could also make an official track for it.

#### Existential questions
This has not much to do with actual concepts ideas but I want to talk about my struggle of not letting myself create games? I don't know why but I'm like I don't want to make games, or moreso be the person who makes games... But maybe I should? I love making them... But I'm holding on to this idea that I'm not a game maker for some reason. I thought I was the cool artist who makes deep installations about surveillance at Mutek. I feel i'm on this weird line where I should choose something to invest my time and for some reason I refuse to fully invest in game making and learning JavaScript and a simple game engine. It's like if I have this vision that it's not cool or serious. That it's not real art. But I don't even want to make art that is serious, it's so boring to me. Even the next installation I have in my mind I want to make it weird and funny. I'll talk more about it in my journal journal. But yeah. I don't know what to do. I feel like not committing to something (for a time) will prevent me from success. Is it just a label thing? Do I care too much about what others think? Sometimes I think yes but other times I really feel I don't care. Making games? Is this really my destiny? Something feels wrong...But it feels so right at the same time.

##### Brainstorming Ideas 2:
I had a couple of ideas related to music. I think it could be interesting to explore what clubbing in the future could look like. It is weird to imagine though because you don't HAVE to do something when you are in a club. You can if you want to but there's no precise goal really, apart from having fun I guess. I can't imagine something else than just going around an online club with an avatar, which is something that already exists and that I don't find particularly exciting. I think the thing that speaks to me about all this is the idea of rhythm. Doing something on rhythm. Or ending up doing something on rhythm because it's funny. This could be like dancing. I guess I could try to make something that is not usually related to clubbing like working a corporate job. But then you would end up doing things on rhythm and get rewarded and encouraged? I think I'm at a point where I just have to prototype something now. Using music and... something? I don't know. I'll try to get inspired by the music. But I know that I like the contrast between dance music and work elements. Also, I always work with dance music.

I'm making a song that I like and I wanted to release it this summer and I thought I could make an interactive video to go with it. I checked a lot of examples of interactive videos but a lot of them felt narrative and choose your adventure type of thing, and I feel the need to do something less linear. I'd like to create a world that is possible to explore, while still having time-based things happen in certain parts of the music. It's a bit of a big project to do but... Maybe I could start with a bunch of small prototypes and see if I can build an environment.

I had an idea that is weird and I don't know if it makes much sense but here is the pitch: What if people in the future could take the plane on their computer and "fly" first class? Hahaha. I think it could be funny to create a user interface that would emulate flying in first class. I see it as a super chic, lounge, expensive and luscious experience where you are free to do whatever you want (order stuff, look outside the window, watch something (exploring the interface basically)) while there still being time-based stuff happening. Now there's another layer I want to add: I want it to feel nostalgic. The idea came from a track that I've been working on in the past couple of weeks called *Jet Set Nostalgia*. It sounds loungy and dance and chic and sexy but still nostalgic and emotional. I think I want this whole thing to be a video for this track. One avenue I'm thinking of working with it is using gifs in dialogue boxes that you can open and close. Hahaha, I feel like this idea only made sense in my head. I'll try to sketch stuff today and see...

Things in planes :
1. Screen to watch something
2. Eat and drink fancy stuff
3. Sleep
4. Look out the window
5. Go to the washroom
6. Take some pills to be less anxious
7. Put seatbelt on
8. Stand up

I should do a list of things that rich people do or things that feel jet set. I think that's funny, to create a jet set experience. haha. Online opulence. Still not 100% trusting myself on all of this haha.
